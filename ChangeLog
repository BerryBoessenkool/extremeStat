This Log of changes in my package extremeStat contains two sections:
1. future development - a list of things I want to change
2. development over time - a log of the changes I already made


----------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. extremeStat - future development
----------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------

- all functions:
# print messages on.exit()
# catch and throw useful error if selection not in list (gpd, eg)
# length of nbest and coldist if selection!=NULL

- distLextreme: 
# Include Bootstrapping with user-specified proportion left out
# add log argument

- distLplot:
# supportends wrong for first example in q_evir
# Correct bug leading to missing cdf points
set.seed(42); rnum <- rbeta(1000, 2, 7)*300
distLplot(distLfit(rnum), cdf=TRUE)
distLplot(distLfit(rnum, truncate=0.01), cdf=TRUE)

- distLprint:
# possibly change to print method for dlf objects with personal class

- distLquantile:
# turn weight off internally if(missing(weighted) & !is.null(selection)) if(length(selection) < 4) weighted <- FALSE
# add option to choose q_evir2 (default: FALSE) for speed
# if trunc=0.98 and all dists for 100% Q at Inf, weighted returns 0!

- q_evir: 
# save image to writeable tempdir
# capture "Graph may look strange !!" cats

2. extremeStat - development over time
----------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.5 (2015--)
various changes, see github commit log at
https://github.com/BerryBoessenkool/extremeStat/commits/master
highlights:
- failed parameter fitting is handled much better, warning messages became useful
- quiet argument added throughout the package
- several defaults were improved 
- documentation was updated and enhanced
- distLgof now returns weights calculated by 3 different methods
- distLplot now uses supdist, package depends on lmomco >=2.1.3 (version that includes supdist)
- installB: moved to https://github.com/brry/installB to remove devtools dependency here


new functions: distLextremePlot, distLprint, distLquantile
renamed distLgofPlot for consistency in lowerCamel-derived case usage.

----------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.4 (2014-12-04)
depends on berryFunctions again (maintaning functions twice is nonsense)
- distLgof now has ks and quiet argument
- distLplot now has las and ylab arguments
- distLfit gained quiet argument



----------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.3 (2014-09-30)
independent from berryFunctions now.
Thus I included lim0, logAxis, logVals, owa, rainbow2, rmse, rsquare
Thinking about how to progress. In my opinion, it would make more sense to depend on berryFunctions, but Ripley does not like to see a subpackage like this on CRAN.

----------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.2 (2014-09-22)
First version submitted to CRAN, was not accepted.
Documentation slightly refined here and there
changed all "cat" to "message"
added datname element in dlf, used for main and xlab in all suitable plots

- distLplot:
# log=TRUE now works properly, as it just draws logAxis
# logargs argument added
# PDF lines now truncated to support region of distribution
# plots with xlim outside of support region now possible without error
# new default for color vector
# density plot now with lim0
# if(percentline), a vartical dashed line at gofProp is drawn

- distLgof:
# plot default is now TRUE

- distLfit
#distLgof is now explicitly called with plot=FALSE

- distLgofplot:
# received a bunch of graphic arguments
# 'order' and 'add' arguments added


----------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.1 (2014-09-15)
Initial build with the functions:
distLextreme (replacing berryFunctions::extremeStatLmom)
distLfit
distLplot
distLgof
distLgofplot
